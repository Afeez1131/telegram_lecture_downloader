# TELEGRAM ISLAMIC LECTURE DOWNLOADER

## Plans:
- If i could figure out a way to access telegram files outside the package I am using, I plan on developing a basic website.
- Enhancing the script's user-friendliness, making it more interactive and intuitive for users to use.

### Note: You must join the telegram channel you want to download from, before you can download from it using the script.

1. **CLONE** the repository on your device

git clone https://github.com/Afeez1131/telegram_lecture_downloader.git
```

2. **CD** into the directory and create a new virtual environment
```bash
cd telegram_lecture_downloader
python -m venv venv
```

3. **Activate** the virtual environment
```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

4. **Install** the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Create a `.env` file, and set values like below; which can be obtained from [https://my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps)!
```bash
API_ID=YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_ID
API_HASH=YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_HASH
```

6. Run the following command to get the details of channels you are a member of:
```bash
python get_channels.py
```
If prompted for your Phone number, enter your telegram phone number, then a code would be sent to it, which you would prompted to provide next.

You should have a similar response to:
```bash
You are subscribed to the following channels:
Channel  channel_name has ID -channel_id and title is: channel title
Channel  channel_name has ID -channel_id and title is: channel title
Channel  channel_name has ID -channel_id and title is: channel title
```

7. Open the `main.py` file, replace the `CHANNEL_NAME` value with any channel name you want to download from.

8. Run the `main.py` file using
```bash
python main.py
```

9. If everything is right, a folder should be created with the name of the channel, and you should see the progress of the files getting downloaded in real-time as below;
```bash
    $ python main.py
